[3.30.2014]
    Added.....: When using --localscan, Eyewitness will attempt to scan and find potential web servers by scanning for machines on the local /24 subnet for common web ports (80, 443, 8080, 8443).  It will write out the live machines to scanneroutput.txt in a format that EyeWitness can use.  Thanks to Rohan Vazarkar helping to write this and get it added to EyeWitness.

    Added.....: Exception handling for server-side disconnects

[3.24.2014]

    Added.....: Added in --difference, lets the user set the difference threshold, which is 50 by default.
    Modified..: Ghost request now, by default, Clicks any popup message with "True" when requesting a web page.  Helps in weird issues, potentially SSL issues.  Thanks to craSH for pointing this out. - Github Issue #27

    Modified..: Location of log file (which is used to detect SSL certificate errors) was moved into folder of the running EyeWitness report, to ensure more than one instance of EyeWitness can be running simultaneously.

[3.15.2014]
    Added.....: Detection of websites using invalid SSL certificates
    Modified..: Setup script to use my modified Ghost library which allows the user to navigate to sites with invalid SSL certs (but also logs a warning).

[3.14.2014]

    Modified..: Updated setup script to use a specific known working commit of Ghost, to prevent any potential future breaks in functionality.

[3.1.2014]
    Modified..: Did a major cleanup of code structure.  Largely needed to not have duplicate code all over EyeWitness when implementing usage of scanning a single URL via a command line argument.
    Added.....: --single for use to scan a single URL - thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for requesting this, it should have been added in the first place - Github Issue #7
    Added.....: Aliased -h, -?, --h, -help, and --help to all produce the help menu if passed in as a parameter.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for the suggestion. - Github Issue #8
    Modified..: Stopped stripping "http://", "https://", and "www" from URLs.  Only stripping "//", ":", and "/" now.  This is due to a logic flaw identified by Robin Wood (@digininja) that would cause images to be overwritten based off the URLs provided. - Github Issue #9
    Added.....: Check to see if URL provided starts with "http://" or "https://", and if not, default to adding "http://" to the front of the url so ghost can resolve it.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for suggesting this. - Github Issue #6
