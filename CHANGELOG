[8.21.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed -d issue in python version of EyeWitness. Thanks for letting me know Robin. - Issue #60
    Modified..: While working on the -d issue, an off by one error was found for the report generation.  This has been fixed.

[8.20.2014]
    Modified..: Added error checking from Robin Woods's (@digininja) supplied code. - Issue # 55
    Modified..: Added gem file where gems can be tracked and installed easier - thanks Robin - Issue # 56

[8.4.2014]
    Modified..: Code that parses file input (single URL per line) now ignored blank lines within the file.  Thanks to webyeti and the APT students at blackhat.

[7.27.2014]
    Modified..: Changed header request to perform a HEAD request, vs. a get.  Hopefully should save some time.  Thanks @harmj0y for the suggestion.

[7.21.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed a bug where the time and date wouldn't be shown at the top of the report when providing the directory path for the report.

[7.16.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed bug when encountering a web page over ssl that a handshake can't be established.  Thanks to @harmj0y for reporting this.

[7.15.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed bug when encountering an unknown error.  Thanks to @harmj0y for reporting this.
    Modified..: Changed how timeout works with Selenium.  By default, EyeWitness will wait up to 10 seconds for a web page to load for the screenshot.  If it doesn't load in time, it will throw an error.  This value cannot currently be changed via the command line.  If it needs to be changed, simple change the value on line 28 within EyeWitness.rb.  The timeout value specified with --timeout is for the server header information.  This is still modified by the value passed with --timeout.

[7.14.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed bug in nmap parser that would return mac addresses as the hostname when parsing nmap xml output.  Thanks for Steve Borosch (rvrsh3ll) for pointing out the issue to me.
    Modified..: HTML source code is now readable, '\n' is used to help :)
    Modified..: Link structure is now placed at the top of the page (and bottom)

[7.13.2014]
    Released..: Ruby version of Eyewitness (Use this one unless you have to use the python version)
    Thanks....: Thanks to Rohan Vazarkar (@cptjesus) for porting his url sorting function to ruby

[6.30.2014]
    Added.....: --no-dns flag can be used when parsing nmap or nessus xml to generate the web server list by IP addresses, and not dns names.  Thanks to @digininja for initially bringing this up, being patient while I try to think of a decent way to do this, and then @webbreacher for providing the simple solution I should have thought of.

[5.30.2014]
    Modified..: Eyewitness now properly closes any xvfb session at the end of a successful run. - Continuation of Github Issue #45 - Thanks Robin for working and troubleshooting fixes with me.
    Modified..: EyeWitness Nmap xml parser now checks if multiple IPs (which have a hostname) have the same hostname.  If so, it will automatically switch to using the IP to identify the web server vs. the hostname, thereby preventing overwrites. Thanks for reporting this Robin.  Really interesting logic flaw to find and fix. - Github Issue #52

[5.29.2014]
    Added.....: Setup script now checks the apt-get install and ensures it returns a 0 status.  Any non-zero status will alert the user of an error and stop the install process. Thanks Robin for reporting this - Github Issue #51
    Modified..: Nmap xml parser now checks if hostname exists in the URL list before adding it to it.  If it does exist, it'll add the IP address instead. Thanks Robin for pointing out this logic issue. - Github Issue #52

[5.23.2014]
    Added.....: Check to make sure user is using python version 2.7.x.  Any other version will fail (gracefully) :) - Github Issue #44 - Thanks Robin
    Modified..: Command line options are now grouped together based on similarity.
    Added.....: Check to make sure directory (if provided by user) doesn't exist.  If so, prompt before overwriting. - Github Issue #47 - Thanks Robin

[5.16.2014]
    Modified..: Added link structure to the top of the report. Thanks for suggestion Robin - Github Issue #41
    Modified..: EyeWitness handles exceptions when receiving a decode error for server header responses - Github Issue #35
    Added.....: Amap file output parsing added.  Thanks to Jonathan Murray for submitting the parsing code.

[5.13.2014]
    Modified..: Local scan now automatically puts "http:\\" before any IP:port combo discovered as being live, except for port 443, and it will put "https:\\"

[5.9.2014]
    Added.....: Message to user now displayed when using EyeWitness's --createtargets flag
    Modified..: Windows binary of EyeWitness now can connect to https websites, fixed a bug where pyinstaller binaries specifically require the ssl import.  Thanks to Arch Beard for informing me of the issue. (Needed to specifically add ssl import for it to work with pyinstaller)

[5.7.2014]
    Modified..: Removed specific exception EyeWitness was unaware of.

[5.6.2014]
    Modified..: Added a specific exception and generic exception handler to backup request (previously it only handled specific exceptions).
    Added.....: --createtargets flag will create a file of all the targets (useful to make a quick target list from a nmap xml or nessus file)
    Added.....: There is now a website counter next to the url letting you know how many URLs EyeWitness has gone through and the total remaining.

[5.5.2014]
    Modified..: File outputs by EyeWitness have had their delimeter changed (pull request #38)
    Modified..: Variable within EyeWitness for an error was the wrong variable name

    Modified..: Fixed OS detection
    Modified..: Removed subprocess library since it is no longer needed

[4.23.2014]
    Added.....: Source code of windows version of EyeWitness is within Windows/.  Only modification are the libraries being imported.
    Modified..: EyeWitness is now windows compatible.  To run on Windows, you would need to install all the required libraries (PyQt4 or PySide, Ghost, netaddr), or simply download the .exe version of EyeWitness at https://www.christophertruncer.com/InstallMe/EyeWitness.exe
    Modified..: EyeWitness will now still run if signatures file isn't within the same directory as EyeWitness, but it will print a warning for each URL and will skip the signature/default creds check

[4.22.2014]
    Added.....: EyeWitness now attempts to sort similar web pages based off of their title tag - Pull Request from Rvazarker (Rohan).  Thanks to Rohan for adding this feature in to EyeWitness.
    Modified..: --localscan now takes CIDR notation as its input
    Modified..: Bug when checking for valid input on the --difference flag
    Modified..: Bug from when the report date and time has been added to the top of the report.
    Merged....: Rohan Vazarkar's pull request

[4.8.2014]
    Modified..: Changed some of the directory creation logic, specifically when specifying the specific output directory to use.  Thanks to Robin Wood for pointing this out. - Github Issue #31

[3.30.2014]
    Added.....: When using --localscan, Eyewitness will attempt to scan and find potential web servers by scanning for machines on the local /24 subnet for common web ports (80, 443, 8080, 8443).  It will write out the live machines to scanneroutput.txt in a format that EyeWitness can use.  Thanks to Rohan Vazarkar helping to write this and get it added to EyeWitness.

[3.28.2014]
    Modified..: Small code formatting update.

[3.27.2014]

[3.25.2014]
    Added.....: Add the --skipcreds flag, which will skip checking for default credentials and will just gather header responses and a screenshot.
    Modified..: Modified the directory specification for the report output to now allow full paths. Github Issue #26
    Added.....: Exception handling for server-side disconnects

[3.24.2014]
    Modified..: Completed user agent switching.  It detects differences in requests from the baseline request based off of html source length.  If beyond a difference of 50 in length between the new request and the baseline, it will add the new useragent request to the report.
    Added.....: Added in --difference, lets the user set the difference threshold, which is 50 by default.
    Modified..: Ghost request now, by default, Clicks any popup message with "True" when requesting a web page.  Helps in weird issues, potentially SSL issues.  Thanks to craSH for pointing this out. - Github Issue #27

[3.20.2014]
    Added.....: Began working on adding user agent switching capabilities

[3.18.2014]

    Modified..: Location of folder creating function moved outside of if statements.
    Modified..: User now able to skip sleep by Ctrl+C during sleep of --jitter
    Modified..: Location of log file (which is used to detect SSL certificate errors) was moved into folder of the running EyeWitness report, to ensure more than one instance of EyeWitness can be running simultaneously.

[3.15.2014]
    Added.....: Detection of websites using invalid SSL certificates
    Modified..: Setup script to use my modified Ghost library which allows the user to navigate to sites with invalid SSL certs (but also logs a warning).

[3.14.2014]
    Added.....: Jitter functionality added in. If using -jitter <# of seconds>, it will randomize the URL list, and sleep between requests for a value of <# of seconds> - 30% of Num seconds provided
    Modified..: Found potential issue with default creds function being called in the wrong location
    Modified..: Moved instantiation of Ghost object
    Modified..: EyeWitness can now be called from any location - Github Issue #18
    Modified..: Changed variables to be multi-line strings (where applicable) - Github Issue #17
    Modified..: Slightly changed help menu, if no file provided, EyeWitness help screen is shown
    Modified..: Added ability to name output directory with -d switch - Github Issue #19
    Modified..: Fixed bug in nmap xml parser that would happen if "tunnel" value didn't exist

[3.8.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed issue where providing EyeWitness with 1025+ URLs would cause the process to hit its file descriptor limit.  Issue has been fixed. - Github Issue # 15

[3.7.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed backupRequest function to receive the correct variable
    Modified..: Files being opened are now done properly

[3.5.2014]
    Modified..: Setup script updated to add xvfb package so EyeWitness can run in a headless install. Thanks to baptistedonaux for letting me know and @themightyshiv for testing it out. Github Issue #13

[3.2.2014]
    Modified..: Server header responses are now properly decoded from unicode rather than just stripping the u' from the string.  Thanks to Ian Gallagher for pointing this out - Github Issue #3
    Modified..: Updated setup script to use a specific known working commit of Ghost, to prevent any potential future breaks in functionality.

[3.1.2014]
    Modified..: Did a major cleanup of code structure.  Largely needed to not have duplicate code all over EyeWitness when implementing usage of scanning a single URL via a command line argument.
    Added.....: --single for use to scan a single URL - thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for requesting this, it should have been added in the first place - Github Issue #7
    Added.....: Aliased -h, -?, --h, -help, and --help to all produce the help menu if passed in as a parameter.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for the suggestion. - Github Issue #8
    Modified..: Stopped stripping "http://", "https://", and "www" from URLs.  Only stripping "//", ":", and "/" now.  This is due to a logic flaw identified by Robin Wood (@digininja) that would cause images to be overwritten based off the URLs provided. - Github Issue #9
    Added.....: Check to see if URL provided starts with "http://" or "https://", and if not, default to adding "http://" to the front of the url so ghost can resolve it.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for suggesting this. - Github Issue #6
